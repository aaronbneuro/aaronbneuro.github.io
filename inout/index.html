<!--
As neuroscientists, we believe our work has the potential to impact almost every human endeavour.
Therefore, it behooves us to be in contact with as broad a range of disciplines as possible.
-->

<blockquote>
<p/>
The "Inside-Out" seminars bring professors from professors from other Princeton departments to speak with the PNI community about scholarship that impacts ideas and practices in our field.
We are hoping to foster a trans-disciplinary dialogue that enriches our understanding of the societal forces shaping neuroscience and vice-versa.

<p/>

The first series will feature talks on a range of topics:
how neuroscience impacts and interacts with conceptions of race;
how "free will" is formulated in quantum mechanics;
how implicit biases can be measured in machine learning models of human language use - and what this might mean for how bias is transmitted;
and how the metaphors we use to think about the mind and brain have shaped their study in science and medicine.

<p/>

The four seminars will be held on Thursdays, at 4:30pm, in <a href="http://m.princeton.edu/map/campus?feed=91eda3cbe8&group=princeton&featureindex=0659&category=91eda3cbe8%3AALL&_b=%5B%7B%22t%22%3A%22Map%22%2C%22lt%22%3A%22Map%22%2C%22p%22%3A%22index%22%2C%22a%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a> Room A32, the time and location regularly reserved for Neuroscience Seminars, and will be followed by a reception with the speakers.
The lectures will be video recorded and posted online.
