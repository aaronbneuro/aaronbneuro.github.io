<h2>so you want to work in the lab...</h2>

great! i appreciate your interest. i'm always on the lookout for excellent collaborators.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<u>general requirements</u><br/>
generally speaking, i <i>strongly</i> prefer to take on collaborators who have one or more of the following skills:<br/>
<ul>
computer programming (we primarily use python and matlab, but if you have experience with other languages that might be ok, too)<br/>
statistics (R, matlab, julia)<br/>
a strong mathematical background<br/>
prior experience doing hands-on lab work in behavioral and brain sciences<br/>
another skill that we'd like to strengthen in the lab (e.g. psychiatric patients, EEG/MEG/ECoG experience, animal models)<br/>
</ul>

<u>specific positions</u><br/>
if you're interested in working with me, i always want to hear from you.
while i might not have space for a particular role at a given time, we can talk about future plans, or i can direct you to a colleague who might be a good match.
<br/> &nbsp; <br/>

here's how to apply as a(n):<br/>
<ul>
<u>undergraduate research assistant (part-time, for credit)</u><br/>
i accept undergraduate RAs via the _ program.
to sign up, go through the cognitive science department.
i can advise a small number of independent thesis projects, and/or you can support existing work in the lab in order to get hands-on experience.
<br/>
<b>i don't encourage applications for summer interns</b> - summer work is almost always going to be an extension of academic year work.
if you think you have an exceptional idea for a summer project, you can email me, but if it's really great it probably can't get done in three months.

<br/> &nbsp; <br/>

<u>paid research assistant (full-time)</u><br/>
this is a great way to bridge between undergraduate work and a phd application.
you will be required to support one or more existing projects, and do some lab administration work, but you will also get a chance to develop and execute your own research ideas.
i ask a minimum two-year commitment, but will consider shorter stays under exceptional circumstances.
<b>unfortunately i am not able to sponsor visas for international applicants to this position.</b>
email me directly with a <u><b>brief</b></u> (max two paragraphs) message covering: a) what kind of research you want to do, b) any relevant experience or coursework, and c) your expected timeframe.

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<u>graduate researcher</u><br/>
if you'd like to get a phd with me, you have a few options.
first, check with me to see if i've got space in the lab.
then, decide your route!
these differ mainly in the admissions requirements, coursework, teaching loads, and funding structure.
i encourage you to reach out to the departments directly with any questions about the program.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<ul>
1. <a href="">cognitive science</a><br/>
<dd>this is the most direct route.
you'll join my lab from day one.
depending on the year, i may have a direct influence on admissions.
you will be funded for at least five years, though you will be required to teach one class per quarter during the year.
i hope to be able to offer guaranteed teaching releases in the near future, but can't promise that yet.
(i <b>always</b> guarantee summer funding.)
</dd><br/>
2. <a href="">neurobiology and behavior (NBB)</a><br/>
<dd>i can be your primary advisor, and we can begin working on projects from day one, but you will also have to do a rotation with at least one or two other labs (which should be a good thing!).
while i can't <i>guarantee</i> funding after the second year, my understanding is that there are many opportunities to acquire it.
i don't have direct influence on admissions, but there's a chance someone might listen to me.
</dd><br/>
3. <a href="">psychology</a><br/>
<dd>same deal as NBB as far as funding and indirect influence on admissions, and as cog sci as far as joining my lab directly from day one.
</dd><br/>
4. <a href="">computer science</a><br/>
<dd>this is the most indirect route - i can't be your primary advisor (and have no say in the admissions process), however you have <a href="http://cs.uci.edu/faculty">a wide range of excellent people</a> to pick from, and will be able to work with me from day one.
</dd><br/>
</ul>

<u>postdoc</u><br/>
email me directly with a <b>brief</b> idea of what you want to work on.
include a cv, email addresses of a few references and a timeframe.
please try to reach out at least a year before you'd want to start.
ideally, we have complementary skills, and you have an idea of what you want to work on, but it's ok if you just want to spitball ideas, too - i've got <a href="projects.html">a bunch of projects</a> i'd love to work with you on!
let me know upfront if you think you'd like to work jointly with me and someone else at UCI (or elsewhere!) - this isn't always easy to do, but it is sometimes possible.
if you don't have funding secured, then we will apply for some together, but regardless, if i offer you a position it will come with at least two years of guaranteed funding.

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<u>visiting scholar</u><br/>
visiting scholars should at least have a masters.
please email me directly with a <b>brief</b> idea of what you want to work on.
include a cv and email addresses of a few references, a timeframe, and some sense of how you want to go about funding your visit, even if it's just an idea.<br/>
</ul>

if you're joining for one of the full-time salaried positions (paid RA, graduate researcher, postdoc), here's <a href="trainee_package.html">what you can expect</a>.
