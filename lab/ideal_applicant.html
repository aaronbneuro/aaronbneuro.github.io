An ideal application consists of the following:

- Recommendations from people who I know well or whose work I respect.

- Demonstrations of work with technical sophistication and clear, well thought-out experiments; or an understanding of and critical assessment towards the work they have participated in.

- A statement that makes clear that there is a strong match between our interests, and demonstrates that these interest are genuine so that I can be sure they will follow through on them.

- During the statement or interview a sense that we have a match in personality and temperament, most importantly that the applicant will be a positive contributor to lab by helping to make a healthy, safe, and supportive work environment for everyone.


Not all of these have to be met to admit someone! (Well, except the last one.) That would be a very high bar. But, these are the sorts of things I look for.
